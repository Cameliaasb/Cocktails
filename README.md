## Work in progress
⚠️ Cocktails is a work in progress, and many features are not implemented yet.



## Description
This portfolio project is a cocktail database web application created using Create React App, JavaScript, and Algolia for efficient data filtering. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse and search for cocktails based on their type and keywords.



## Features
- View a list of cocktails with images and details.
- Filter cocktails by type (e.g., 'Martini,' 'Mojito') or keywords (e.g., 'vodka,' 'citrus').
- Search for cocktails based on custom keywords.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Cameliaasb/cocktails.git
```

Change to the project directory:

```
cd cocktails
```

Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

For this project, you don't need to create an Algolia account. My public tokens give you access to the database. If you wish to create your own database, you can create an Algolia account and use it instead.

## Start the development server:

```
npm start
or
yarn start
```

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the cocktail database.

## Usage
On the home page, you can view the list of cocktails.
Use the filter and search options to narrow down the list of cocktails.
